## 🏃 Running

Running is more than a sport to me — it’s a mindset and a source of resilience.  

In 2023, I successfully completed the **Yueyang Marathon (42 km full course)**, a milestone that pushed my limits and left a lasting memory.

## 📷 Photography

Photography allows me to document beauty along the way, especially city streets, campus moments, and portraits of friends.  
A photo, to me, is not just a visual — it’s a memory frozen in emotion.

## 🎮 Esports: League of Legends

Gaming has been a big part of my life for over **11 years**.

I served as the **captain of the varsity League of Legends team at University**, leading strategies, training, and team coordination.  
I reached **Grandmaster (宗师) rank**, placing me in the **top 0.01%** of all players on the server.
That journey required not just mechanics, but also leadership, game sense, and pressure control — skills I still carry into academic life.
